            <h2>Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was one of the great astronomers in history and the first to determine what
                stars are made of.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1900 - Payne-Gaposchkin was born in England.</li>
                <li>1920 - Payne completed his studies in Physics and Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, a
                    university that allowed the presence of women, but without giving them an official degree.</li>
                <li>1923 - she arrived at the Harvard College Observatory.</li>
                <li>1885 - she was employed at the Observatory along with 80 other women to study glass photographs of
                    the stars. They would later be known as Harvard's "computer" women. She was there until 1927.</li>
                <li>1925 - During her research for her doctorate. Payne concluded that stars are composed of hydrogen and
                    helium. Although she was ridiculed, since during that time it was believed that stars had a similar
                    chemical composition to Earth.</li>
                <li>1929 - Henry Norris Russell after recommending to Payne that he remove that idea from her thesis,
                    stating that those results were "clearly impossible." He acknowledged that Payne was right</li>
                <p>La propia Payne se describió a sí misma como "una rebelde contra el rol femenino" y declaró que su verdadera rebelión "estaba en contra de ser pensada y tratada como inferior".</p>
